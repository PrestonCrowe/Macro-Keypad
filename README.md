Designed by vaugerbird

Features
---------

* Features 6 programable macro keys
* Controlled by ATMega32u4 that can be burned with Arduino bootloader
* Uses a USB Type C connector at USB 2.0 speeds

Notes
------

* All of the mechanical key switches are all programed in EAGLE as Cherry MX keys or similar footprint
* ~~Machined aluminium base file for keypad in MasterCAM file format and other formats coming in the next few weeks~~ I've lost the files, so that won't be happening.
* 3D files for case currently in the works

TODO
------
* ~~Route switch airwires~~
* Work on ProMicro PCB
* ~~Figure out what to do for USB port CC pins~~
* Push new files when USB port is fixed
* Create code for new board
* ~~Add ATMega pinout to silkscreen~~
* ~~Add programming header or pads~~
* Possibly make custom board files for Arduino IDE
